# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical React integration issues in the Laravel application where the Vite React plugin fails to detect the proper preamble, causing runtime errors. The system needs to properly serve a React SPA through Laravel while maintaining API communication between the React frontend and Laravel backend. The application should run successfully with both `php artisan serve` (port 8000) and `npm run dev` (port 5173) working in tandem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Vite React Plugin Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vite React plugin to properly detect and process React components, so that the application runs without preamble detection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Vite React plugin SHALL properly detect React JSX syntax without preamble errors
2. WHEN React components are loaded THEN they SHALL render without "@vitejs/plugin-react can't detect preamble" errors
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN Hot Module Replacement SHALL work correctly for React components
4. IF there are JSX syntax issues THEN the build process SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Resolve Package Configuration Conflicts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent package management across the application, so that there are no conflicting dependencies or duplicate configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be only one package.json file managing React dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN there SHALL be no version conflicts between React packages
3. WHEN Vite processes files THEN it SHALL use the correct Babel configuration for JSX transformation
4. IF multiple package.json files exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a single configuration

### Requirement 3: Fix Laravel-React Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Laravel to properly serve the React application, so that users can access the SPA through Laravel routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users visit any route THEN Laravel SHALL serve the React SPA entry point
2. WHEN the React app loads THEN it SHALL properly mount to the designated DOM element
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN React SHALL successfully communicate with Laravel backend endpoints
4. WHEN assets are requested THEN Vite SHALL serve them correctly in development mode

### Requirement 4: Establish Proper File Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized file structure, so that React components and Laravel backend code are properly separated and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN React source files SHALL be in a single, well-organized directory
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent import/export patterns
3. WHEN context providers are used THEN they SHALL be properly structured and exported
4. IF file paths change THEN all imports SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 5: Configure Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to work seamlessly, so that I can develop and test the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `php artisan serve` THEN Laravel SHALL start on port 8000 and serve the React app
2. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN Vite SHALL start on port 5173 with HMR enabled
3. WHEN both servers are running THEN the application SHALL be accessible at localhost:8000
4. WHEN changes are made to React files THEN they SHALL hot reload without full page refresh
5. WHEN changes are made to Laravel files THEN the backend SHALL reflect changes immediately

### Requirement 6: Fix Context Provider Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language switching and authentication features to work properly, so that I can use the application in my preferred language and access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LanguageContext loads THEN it SHALL not throw preamble detection errors
2. WHEN language is switched THEN the UI SHALL update to reflect RTL/LTR changes
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN protected routes SHALL respond appropriately
4. WHEN cart operations are performed THEN the cart state SHALL persist correctly

### Requirement 7: Ensure Production Build Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully for production, so that it can be deployed without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN the production build is created THEN all React components SHALL be properly bundled
3. WHEN Laravel serves the production build THEN all routes SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN assets are loaded in production THEN they SHALL have proper cache headers and optimization
